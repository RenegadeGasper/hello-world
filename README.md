Testing 1, 2, 3!


Hello fellow peers or anyone who freely wishes to see my projects!
I'm Gaspar Efondo, you can call me Gasper since I prefer it.

I'm mainly proficient in Python and C++, right along with HTML and CSS for web design or development
I'm currently learning Java, Javascript, and C#

I wish to be a game programmer or a software developer. 
I dont think I am a good programmer, but I do love to code!
